        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hi there! <span>&#128075;&#127996;</span> Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
            <br> <br>I am currently at the University of Washington majoring
            in <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/"> Human Centered Design
                & Engineering.</a> I am also
            hoping to double degree with business to leverage and translate
            business objectives into responsible
            and satsifying user experiences. To incorporate empathy into the
            perspectives of stakeholders who
            devlop business objectives that are self-serving.
            <br> <br> I am passionate about User Research to enhance and learn
            more about the user's experience and
            to elicit pain points to enhance the overall experience and
            usability. I am passionate about diversity,
            adaptive, and accessible technology for all end users. I want to be
            a part of creating a future that
            anticipates and avoids adverse outcomes, reducing harm and
            increasing well-being for end users.
            With my research skill set I have been able to partcipate in
            different research projects and co-lead
            my own!
