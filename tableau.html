        <h5>
            I had the opproutunity as an undergraduate to sit in a graduate level class, with permission from the instructor. 
            For this class HCDE 517: Usability Studies we got an opprotunity to work in groups on a client based project. My groups
            was given the opprotunity to work with Tableau with the Desktop team. In about 10 weeks we conducted a usability study 
            and presented our findings to the class and the Tableau team. 
        </h5>

        <h2>Purpose & Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this study was to learn more about how beginner Tableau Desktop users experience the dashboard
             creation and interaction process. Specifically, our goal was to discover pain points and barriers beginners 
             face when using Tableau to create dashboards as well as provide recommendations for improvements and next steps.
              In doing so, we hoped to provide useful, data driven insights into how the dashboard experience can be improved 
              for beginners thereby making it more accessible to them.

        </p>

        <h2>Partcipant Overview & Scope</h2>
        <p>
            We had a total of seven partcipants for this study, with 4 male and 3 female partciapnts averaging at the age 
            of 28. We looked for partciapnts that created 1-10 dashboard and that have used Tableau within the last four months.
            We wanted partcipants that were considered intermediate users and looked at how they used Tableau in the past. We considered
            partciapnts who played with the dashboard for personal projects to occasionally creating simple dashboards for work. We also
            noticed 5 out of the 7 partcipants worked in the tech field and had experience used Excel or R.
        </p>

        <h2>Methods & Procedures</h2>
        <p>
            Our team conducted 7 moderated, in person usability test sessions at the University of Washington Odegaard undergraduate
            Library and Sieg Hall. Prior to eahc session we asked every partciapnt a series of pre-test questions guaging things like their
            current attitudes towards Tableau and their use patterns. We presented them with a scenario which proivded context for the 
            20 tasks they were given. Upon completing all tasks, each partciapnt were asked a series of post-test questions to 
            reflect on their experiences as well as the Net Promoter question. All but one partcipant was administered the System
            Usability Scale. <br> <br>

            Methods we used during this study was moderated usability testing and thinking out loud. We wanted the thinking 
            out loud method and session recordings for each session, to look back on to see facial expressions and understand
            there thought process as they completed each task. During the study the moderator interacted directly with the participant
            and guided them through the study by reading the script, answering questions, and probing the partcipant. While the note taker
            was there to write any notes or observations from the session. 
        </p>

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>
            From this usability study we were able to learn a lot from beginner partcipants and understand the pain points they had 
            and the things they liked about Tableau. We were able to analyze the data by reviewing the session recordings
            and affinity mapping with sticky notes. The affinity diagram was successful in terms of organizing 
            each partciapnt with a different color sticky notes and noticing repetive patterns within the partcipants. From our data we noticed:
            <ul>
                <li>The Hide & Unhide Features were confusing</li>
                <li>The "Show Dashboard Title" Function was difficult to find</li>
                <li>There were inconsistencies in sheet and visualization titles</li>
                <li>Partcipants got stuck in the map task and couldn't get back</li>
                <li>Partcipants had trouble filtering visualization and retrieving filter if it was removed </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            From our findings we recommend to combine the name of the sheet/dashboard with the tab titles for more consistency. 
            As well as the "Show Dashboard Title" to be more salient and to have heirachy within the UI, in the current state 
            the Dashboard Title is at the bottom and hard for partcipants to notice. We also recommend to redesign components to be
            more obvious, because Tableau is such a powerful tool and there's a lot of commands and things you can do we recommend
            to make components more obvious to see and notice. 
        </p>

        <h2>Takeways</h2>
        <p>
            If I had the opportunity to run this study again I'd specifically reach out to non-students and students, orginally
            we only recruited partcipants that went to the University of Washington which made recruiting and the scope small. Since we
            mainly focused on finding UW students we tried slack groups, messaging different departments, and trying to find students
            who've used Tableau. Another thing I'd change is be more clear that partcipants won't be judged on their skills using Tableau,
            we had several potential partcipants shy away from partcipant because they felt Tableau was daunting and didn't want to be
            judged on performance or failing tasks. I'd also change and have more practice sessions to check for and resolve any
            techinal issues for running the study. Lastly, I'd want to give the option for partcipants to have a PC option, because
            some partcipants were not familair with Macs and the layout of Tableau slightly changing. 
        </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
            From this experience I learned a lot from the project itself, but also working with graduate level students. I learned
            how to work with a client and design a usability study end-to-end and how to collaboratively and effectively run testing
            as a team. I also learned how to use Tableau, although I wished I learned or was more familiar because partcipants 
            stumbled and got away from the goal and I couldn't help them find there way back. I also learned how to draw meaningful
            conclusions from a usability study data, and how to run and design a usability test on a complex product unfamiliar to me.
