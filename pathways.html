            Background
        </h2>
        <p>
            This Direct Research Project mapped out the journey Human Centered
            Design
            and Engineering (HCDE) graduates take in their careers. This
            research partnered
            up with the HCDE Alumni Leadership Board along with Mike Berg and
            Paula Chuchro
            to identify the diverse range of careers and core transitional
            moments of HCDE alumni.
            The HCDE department sends out alumni survey for new graduates,
            however no research has
            been closely looked at beyond quantitative data.

            <br> <br>The primary goal of the research was to understand the
            experiences and needs of
            HCDE alumni as they navigate their career paths and highlight the
            key transitional
            moments in their journey. We wanted to unravel the ongoing learning,
            networking, and
            other needs and discover how alumni are meeting or not meeting those
            needs today. We
            also wanted to generate and develop alumni involvement and outreach
            to support the
            Alumni Leadership Board in planning events and continuing education
            efforts for
            HCDE students and alumni.

            Research
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our target research group were Senior Alumni who have been in the
            industry for more
            than five years. We conducted secondary research using the data and
            information
            available on the internet to explore: How do departments within a
            university engage
            alumni after graduation, and what are some of the popular events and
            learnings activities
            for UX alumni and professionals? Some of our most insightful
            findings were: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Partcipants in Alumni Panel</li>
                <li>Career assistance through career counseling, career
                    development programs,
                    and self-assessment for department-specific programs.
                </li>
                <li>Benefits and discounts on subscriptions and software</li>
                <li>Representation based on academic programs</li>
                <li>Independent prescence on LinkedIn</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on our secondary research we developed an interview plan to
            conduct eight semi
            structured interviews. The interviews lasted roughly an hour long
            some in person and
            some remote. The screening and recruitment were performed through
            outsourced recruiting
            due to timeline. Our interview were based on these questions: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>What are some of the common career paths and key
                    transitional moments in alumni
                    careers and what are some of the challenges they faced
                    navigating that path?
                </li>
                <li>What are their preferences for ongoing learning,
                    volunteering, and networking
                    needs? What are some of the existing channels and routes
                    they are choosing to
                    meet those?</li>
                <li>How do they interact with the department as alumni today?
                    What factors
                    motivate them to engage with the department activities and
                    with current
                    students in the future? </li>
                <li>
                    What are some of the barriers that prevent them from 
                    staying involved with the HCDE community?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br> 
            Based on our primary and secondary research we were able to find our toppling 
            findings that identified patterns and pain points in engaging with the HCDE community
             and department. We found that alumni look for opportunities that align with their 
             values, such as professional development, industry connections, and updates on the 
             latest UX trends. They want to give and get value. We also found that alumni 
             value connections that they made at different phases of their journey, including 
             their time with the department and after graduation. They emphasized that connections 
             matter. Lastly,  alumni are looking for clear and digestible forms of communication 
             from the department so that they can feel engaged and easily keep in touch. Although 
             personal communication wasn’t a common theme it was an important one they wanted a 
             clear and personal approach.

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
            After researching we created a persona that would create a 
            realistic interpretation of our user group. We included the motivations 
            and pains the interviewees expressed and wanted our persona to evoke empathy 
            to convey our steak holders. <br>
            <img src= "Media /Persona+-+Team+2.png" alt="Persona">
        </p>
        <h2>User Journey Maps</h2>
        <p>
            To better understand the career journey of our interviewees we created a 
            journey map based on the information we found. We wanted to showcase the process 
            and needs they went through starting from post graduation to future aspirations. 
            This map reveals the pleasure and pain points that then reveal opportunities for 
            improvement and change, based on the needs during a specific phase in their life. <br>
            <img src="Media /image-asset.png" alt="JourneyMap">
            <img src="Media /Screen+Shot+2019-10-20+at+9.54.50+PM.png" alt="JourneyMap2">
            <br> Based on our findings we were able to come up with opportunities for growth for 
            the HCDE Alumni Board. We wanted to provide the Board with ideas to involve alumni and 
            to increase ongoing learning. We found that alumni wanted to receive and give value and 
            that they wanted a more personal approach when being reached out to. 
        </p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Something we learned was that small changes can make a big impacts to the future 
            involving alumni. For instance we found that making a more personal approach can get 
            alumni to be more involved. We also found that highlighting alumni and allowing them to 
            present and talk about a topics they are passionate about will encourage their involvement 
            to the department. We also found that involvement for alumni did not necessarily mean donate 
            money, but to come to the events and be involved socially to not only benefit them, but students. 
            We wanted to capitalize that involvement in the program was not for money donation. 
        </p>
        <h4>What I Would do Differently? </h4>
        <p>
            Something I would do differently is to find more participants, we ended up having 
            one outlier who wasn't too interested in getting involved. I wish I could have asked 
            him more questions to see what was valuable for him specifically to come and be more 
            involved with the program. I think I would also like to research participants/alumni 
            that aren’t in the state anymore and see how we can get them to be involved with the
             program. Not necessary have them come back to Washington to be involved, but how we 
             can support them where they are and possibly other alumni that are around that region 
             as well. I also would like to interview other participants who aren’t necessarily 
             involved with HCDE, but who are alumni at other college and universities that could 
             also help benefit current students. I think it would be interesting to see the future 
             of HCDE to be more inclusive to the UX world to allow students to learn different 
             perspectives and hats in the industry. I think the future of that would be beneficial 
             to current students but also alumni to create a broader social network. I think this 
             would encourage the HCDE program is broaden out and help out current students and 
             alumni.
